            <p class="e-content"> 
                The aim of the document is to answer the question “What is hypertext” in its own method.
                <br>
                <br>
                 Noah Warden first covers how communities offer different answers to the question. These communities
                are the literary and the computer science community. Noah recognises the effect of a community on
                their definitions of the word and how each of their biased opinions of the definitions are valid.
                Tangent -The elasticity of words will cause them to evade a singular meaning. Words are borrowed
                and twisted to fit varying fields and times. The meaning is always valid if enough humans agree on a
                meaning. The meaning is based in consensus. As to how many must agree for a meaning is
                formalised is difficult. Words can have different meanings between cultures of billions of people, but
                also just between two people. This tangent of my own thought leads me to critique the document:
                merely asking “What is hypertext” is insufficient, and who ever wants to know what the meaning is
                should also elaborate to which context do they seek the meaning. And the most thorough way to
                answer such a general question would be to supply all possible meanings of the word, formal and
                informal.
                <br>
                <br>
                In attempt to create a better understanding of the word, Noah looks to the origin of it. Noah outlines
                how Theodor Holm (“Ted”) Nelson first coined the term, along with the other terms; Hyperfilm and
                Hypermedia. Nelson explains hypermedia as “Hyper-media are branching or performing
                presentations which respond to user actions, systems of prearranged words and pictures (for
                example) which may be explored freely or queried in stylized ways.” Using this and hyperlinks
                Nelson explains hypertexts as “chunk style, hypertexts consist of separate pieces of text connected
                by links.” And that hypertext is a hypermedia.
                <br>
                <br>
                From the previous definitions Noah’s work culminates in the form of the definition :
                “Hypertext is a term coined by Ted Nelson for forms of hypermedia (human-authored media that
                branch or perform on request) that operate textually. Examples include the link-based ‘discrete
                hypertext’ (of which the Web is one example) and the level-of-detail-based ‘stretchtext.’”.
                Considering the path of definition that Noah had made, I consider this accurate. It may not
                encompass every meaning of the word ‘Hypertext’, but it fulfils the standards he had set for the
                definition.
                <br>
                <br>
                What does hypertext mean to me? Well, every definition that can be found is valid in my opinion.
                A note to Hanli Geyser, or whomever is reading this.
                I feel like I have gone too far in a peculiar direction and started talking less about what hyper text is
                and rather the methodology/reasoning that the author utilises to find the conclusion of the piece of
                work. The reason I found is that the author had already described the term ‘Hypertext’ very well and
                if I wanted to explain it myself, this whole text could have been just a reference to Noah’s work.</p>
